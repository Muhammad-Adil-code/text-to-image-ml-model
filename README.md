## 📚 Features Covered in the Notebook

### 🔹 1. Image Generation using AI
We generate images from text prompts using pre-trained models like DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or other custom APIs (depending on setup).

### 🔹 2. Text-to-Image Functionality
A core feature of this notebook is the ability to take a **user-provided text prompt** (like `"A sunset over the mountains"`) and convert it into a visual representation.
